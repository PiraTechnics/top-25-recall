# NCAA Top 25 Football Recall

Technically it's a top 24, but who's counting? Oh, I guess we are ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

## How 2 Play

Click on each of the team logos to score points, but do you best to remember which ones you click! After each point, the board shuffles, and it is up to you to keep track of the ones you've clicked aready. Double up on a team, and it's back to beginning!
